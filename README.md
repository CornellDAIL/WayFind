### Description
This project was initially created as a research tool to track behavioral markers and indoor location data given the lack of any existing accurate, low-cost options. However, WayFind was created with modularity in mind so that researchers can tailor it to their specific research needs.

### Setup
WayFind is being run on Python v. 3.9.12.

#### Dependencies
WayFind utilizes the following libraries and versions for its functionality:
- tkinter (v. 8.6)
- pandas (v. 1.3.5)
- PIL (v. 9.0.1)
- functools (legacy)
- subprocess (legacy)
- time (legacy)
- datetime (legacy)
- logging (legacy)
