## Description
WayFind was created a multi-modal research tool to track behavioral markers and indoor location data given the lack of any existing accurate, low-cost options. In field studies that DAIL conducted utilizing WayFind, it was run on a Microsoft Surface tablet with a stylus. However, WayFind was created with modularity in mindâ€”it can be run on any platform or device, and researchers of any discipline can tailor it to their specific research needs.

## Setup
WayFind is being run on Python v. 3.9.12.

### Dependencies
WayFind utilizes the following libraries and versions for its functionality:
- tkinter (v. 8.6)
- pandas (v. 1.3.5)
- PIL (v. 9.0.1)
- functools (legacy)
- subprocess (legacy)
- time (legacy)
- datetime (legacy)
- logging (legacy)

Please install them prior to start.
